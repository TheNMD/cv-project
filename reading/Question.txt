Dear students,

As I announced in the class, we will have the essay for the course. 

In this essay, you are free to pick up any topic that we have discussed and perform a deep investigation about it. 

That includes a literature survey about the problem, your desired approach, some experiments that you have performed, and your idea for future improvements.

Please submit your report here. I won't accept any reports through email.
